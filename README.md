# ASPP

### ASPP - Auto Starting Python Project

This project was created to automate the launch of projects on YAP Python on a PC. The project also implies an automatic restart of the project when it breaks down.

### manual

1) Choose your preferred OS;
2) Select and run the .py file (or .exe file for OS windows);
3) Enter the required data;

The program will compile an executable file for the required OS and add it to the autorun of the system, this file will run the project on the path you entered each time the OS is started (and restart as needed). If there is no project, the executable file will complete its execution.

Enjoy using it :)
